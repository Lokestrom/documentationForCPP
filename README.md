This is the documentation for all of my C++ libraryes and projects.

HTML folder:
It has all the html and css files. Just run the main.html file.

TXT folder:
It has txt files. It is where editing the content of the documentation happen.

Cpp folder:
It contains the code for creating the html files from the txt files. 
This is done to make it easier to edit the content and make sure that all the files have the same style and structure.
